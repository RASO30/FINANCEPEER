Problem Statement:
Build a basic web application having the following features:
1. An authentication system.
2. Upload a file and save the data in the database.
3. Display the data saved in the database(use styling and themes as required).
Tasks:
1. Build a web application with some sort of authentication system. The users must be able
to login and logout of the system. You can use any form of authentication for this.
2. Create a panel to upload a JSON file (shared separately) add validations for the type of
file, the content of the file, etc. Parse and save this data to the database.
3. Create a page to display all the records from the database(use styling and themes as
required).
Note:
 Preferably use Django(for backend), React(for frontend) and PostgreSQL(database), if
you have never used any from the above stack feel free to use what you are comfortable
with.
 Design proper database tables and structures wherever required.
 Package the entire project, add a readme file for installation guidelines.
 Once completed upload project on GIT and share GIT repo with us.
 Performing Unit testing is a plus.

PS:
 It is fine if you don’t know any of these technologies.
 Feel free to use internet.
 Don’t hesitate to ask for help. Asking help will not devalue the selection process.
 Working product is what matters and we will not count how many times you asked for
help.
